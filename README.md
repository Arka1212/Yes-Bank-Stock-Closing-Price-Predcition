# Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction

## Problem Statement
Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month. The main objective is to predict the stock’s closing price of the month.

## Project Approach
A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares." The value of shares depends on the investors, whether more people are buying the stock or selling it, follows the simple supply – demand rule.

So, my aim was to apply different regression models on the given data to predict the closing price of the stock and then compare all the models to figure out the best one for this job. Following is the pathway followed during the whole process:
* Started off with data overview, just to understand what’s in the dataset and in order to inspect how clean the dataset is for working.
